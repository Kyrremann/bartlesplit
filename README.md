# Bartlesplit

> Bartleby is a baby Rat Creature adopted by Fone Bone and Smiley.

Bartlesplit is based on [Cheapino](https://github.com/tompi/cheapino) by Tompi.
The original idea was to build a Cheapino with hot swaps, but it evolved into something more!

At the same time I was working on Bartlesplit, a friend of mine suggested that we try to make a splithub, letting us avoid having the Pro Micro directly on the board.
This is mostly a design choice, as it means you need to have a hub for each keyboard to avoid switching Pro Micros.
We have called the hub [The Japanese Connection](https://github.com/Kyrremann/the-japanese-connection) since it's relying on the Japanese duplex matrix.

One of the main feature of the board is the built-in tenting, so you don't need to make a case to get simple tenting.
